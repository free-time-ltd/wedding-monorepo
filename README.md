# Wedding Website With Chat

This is a project for my wedding and website

## ToDos

- Once connected to server - Sonner notifications when new messages arrive and you are not on the chat page
- Make sure /chat handles itself and /chat/\* so that users may share chat URLs
- Clear raw socket.io from backend and from frontend (npm rm)
- Listen for navigator.onLine changes and show proper notifications if the network goes away
